## 📁 Launcher Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `START.bat` | 1-click launcher (requires Python installed) |
| `build_exe.bat` | Builds standalone .exe for distribution |
| `app_launcher.py` | Wrapper script for executable build |
| `QUICK_START.md` | Detailed setup instructions |

## 📦 Building the Standalone Executable (For Developers)

To create the standalone `.exe` package for distribution to end users:

1. **Run the build script:**
   ```bash
   build_exe.bat
   ```
   (PyInstaller will be installed automatically if needed)

2. **Find the output in the `dist` folder (NOT `build`):**
   ```
   dist/                              ← CORRECT folder
   └── Hypertrophy-Toolbox/
       ├── Hypertrophy-Toolbox.exe   ← Run this!
       ├── RUN_APP.bat
       └── _internal/                 ← Required support files (do not delete)
   ```

   > **Important:** The `build` folder contains temporary files and will NOT work. Always use `dist`.

3. **Distribute:** Zip the entire `dist/Hypertrophy-Toolbox/` folder and share with users
