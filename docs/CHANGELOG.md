# Changelog

All notable changes to Hypertrophy Toolbox v3.

## v1.5.0 - February 5, 2026

### New Features: Auto Starter Plan Generator Phase 2

#### Double Progression Logic
- Smart progression suggestions based on rep range performance
- When hitting top of rep range (e.g., 12 reps in 8-12 range) → suggests weight increase
- When below minimum (e.g., 6 reps in 8-12 range) → suggests pushing reps back into range
- Detects repeated failures and suggests weight reduction
- Conservative increments for novices (2.5kg) vs experienced lifters (5kg)
- Considers effort (RIR 1-3 or RPE 7-9) before suggesting weight increase

#### Priority Muscle Reallocation
- New `priority_muscles` parameter in plan generator API
- Automatically boosts volume for selected muscle groups
- Adds +1 set to existing accessories targeting priority muscles
- "Clear volume for volume" strategy: reduces non-essential work to make room
- Never removes core movement patterns (squat, hinge, push, pull)
- Available via `/get_generator_options` endpoint

#### Movement Pattern Coverage Analysis
- New `/api/pattern_coverage` endpoint
- Analyzes workout plan for movement pattern balance
- Tracks sets per routine (warns if outside 15-24 range)
- Detects missing core patterns (squat, hinge, horizontal/vertical push/pull)
- Warns about push/pull imbalance (>50% skew)
- Flags excessive isolation-to-compound ratio
- Returns actionable recommendations with severity levels

### API Changes
- `POST /generate_starter_plan`: Added `priority_muscles` parameter
- `GET /get_generator_options`: Added `priority_muscles.available` with all muscle groups
- `GET /api/pattern_coverage`: New endpoint for program analysis
- `POST /get_exercise_suggestions`: Enhanced with double progression logic

### Tests
- Added 25 tests for double progression logic
- Added 15 tests for priority muscle and pattern coverage
- Total test coverage: 294 tests passing

### Documentation
