# Program Backup / Program Library

## Overview

The Program Backup feature allows users to save snapshots of their current workout program and restore them later. This enables users to:

1. **Experiment safely** with new programs and quickly restore previous ones without rebuilding from scratch
2. **Recover quickly** after using erase/reset operations, thanks to automatic backups

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to save my current workout program so I can experiment with a new one without losing my work
- As a user, I want to see a list of my saved programs with their creation dates and exercise counts
- As a user, I want to restore a saved program to make it my active workout plan
- As a user, I want to delete old backups I no longer need
- As a user, when I erase my data, I want an automatic backup created so I can recover if needed

## Storage Approach

### Database Tables

Backups are stored in two dedicated SQLite tables that are separate from the active program tables:

#### `program_backups` (Header/Metadata)
```sql
CREATE TABLE program_backups (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,                    -- User-provided name
    note TEXT,                             -- Optional description
    backup_type TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'manual',  -- 'manual' or 'auto'
    schema_version INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,   -- For future migrations
    item_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,       -- Number of exercises
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(name, created_at)
)
```

#### `program_backup_items` (Exercise Data)
```sql
CREATE TABLE program_backup_items (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    backup_id INTEGER NOT NULL,            -- FK to program_backups
    routine TEXT NOT NULL,                 -- e.g., "Workout A"
    exercise TEXT NOT NULL,                -- Exercise name
    sets INTEGER NOT NULL,
    min_rep_range INTEGER NOT NULL,
    max_rep_range INTEGER NOT NULL,
    rir INTEGER,                           -- Reps in Reserve
    rpe REAL,                              -- Rate of Perceived Exertion
    weight REAL NOT NULL,
    exercise_order INTEGER,                -- Optional ordering (may be NULL)
    FOREIGN KEY (backup_id) REFERENCES program_backups(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
)
```

### Design Decisions

- **Separate Tables**: Backups are stored in dedicated tables, completely isolated from the active program (`user_selection`). This ensures backups survive erase/reset operations.
- **Schema Versioning**: The `schema_version` field enables future migrations if the backup format needs to change.
- **Optional Fields**: Fields like `exercise_order`, `rir`, and `rpe` are nullable to handle cases where the source data doesn't have these values.
- **Cascading Deletes**: Deleting a backup header automatically deletes its items via `ON DELETE CASCADE`.

}
```

## Restore Rules

### Replace Mode (Default)
When restoring a backup, the system:
1. Clears all current entries in `user_selection` and `workout_log`
2. Inserts all backed-up items that have valid exercises in the catalog

### Missing Exercise Handling
If an exercise in the backup no longer exists in the exercises catalog:
- The item is **skipped** (not inserted)
- The skipped exercise name is added to the `skipped` list in the response
- The restore continues with remaining valid items
- **No FK constraint errors** occur

### Optional Columns
- `exercise_order`: Used if present in both backup and target schema, ignored otherwise
- `rir`, `rpe`: Stored as NULL if not present in source data

### Versioning
The `schema_version` field (currently `1`) allows future migrations:
- Version 1: Current format
- Future versions may add fields; restore logic handles missing fields gracefully

## Erase/Reset Integration

### Auto-Backup Behavior
When the `/erase-data` endpoint is called:

1. **Before erasing**: If the active program has data (`user_selection` is not empty):
   - An automatic backup is created with name: `"Pre-Erase Auto-Backup (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)"`
   - Backup type is set to `"auto"`

2. **During erase**: Program tables are dropped and reinitialized:
   - `user_selection`
   - `workout_log`
   - `progression_goals`
   - `muscle_volumes`
   - `volume_plans`

3. **Backup tables are NOT affected**:
   - `program_backups`
   - `program_backup_items`

4. **Response includes auto-backup info** (if created):
```json
{
    "ok": true,
    "status": "success",
    "message": "All data has been erased... Auto-backup 'Pre-Erase Auto-Backup (2026-02-03 10:30:00)' created with 12 exercises.",
    "data": {
        "id": 5,
        "name": "Pre-Erase Auto-Backup (2026-02-03 10:30:00)",
        "item_count": 12
    }
}
```

### UI Auto-Backup Banner
After an erase operation, if an auto-backup was created, the UI shows a dismissible banner:
- Displays backup name and exercise count
- "Restore Now" button to immediately restore the backup
- Banner can be dismissed if user doesn't want to restore

## Tests

### Test File: `tests/test_program_backup.py`

#### Test Coverage

1. **Create backup saves active program data**
   - Verify backup metadata is correct
   - Verify item count matches
   - Verify all fields are captured correctly

2. **Restore backup (replace mode)**
   - Create backup → Mutate active program → Restore
   - Verify active program matches backup snapshot

3. **Restore skips missing exercises**
   - Create backup with exercises
   - Delete one exercise from catalog
   - Restore should succeed with fewer items
   - Response includes skipped exercise list

4. **Delete backup removes it**
   - Create backup → Delete → Verify gone
   - Verify items are also cascade-deleted

5. **Erase/reset integration**
   - Verify auto-backup created when program has data
   - Verify auto-backup skipped when program empty
   - Verify backups survive erase operation

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all backup tests
pytest tests/test_program_backup.py -v

# Run specific test class
pytest tests/test_program_backup.py::TestProgramBackup -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/test_program_backup.py --cov=utils.program_backup --cov=routes.program_backup -v
```

## Manual QA Checklist

### Basic Operations
- [ ] Create a backup with name and optional note
- [ ] List backups shows all saved programs
- [ ] View backup details shows exercise count
- [ ] Restore backup replaces current program
- [ ] Delete backup removes it from list

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Creating backup with empty program works (0 items)
- [ ] Restoring with missing exercises shows skipped list
- [ ] Backup name is required (validation error if empty)
- [ ] Duplicate backup names allowed (different timestamps)

### Erase Integration
- [ ] Erase with non-empty program creates auto-backup
- [ ] Erase with empty program doesn't create backup
- [ ] Auto-backup appears in program library with "auto" type
- [ ] Backups survive after erase operation
- [ ] "Restore Now" banner appears after erase (if auto-backup created)

### UI/UX
- [ ] "Save Program" button opens save modal
- [ ] "Program Library" button opens library modal
- [ ] Restore confirmation dialog works
- [ ] Delete confirmation dialog works
- [ ] Toast notifications show success/error messages
- [ ] After restore, workout plan table refreshes
